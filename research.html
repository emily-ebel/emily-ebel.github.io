       Microbiome
</p></h2>

The human body contains nearly equal numbers of human and bacterial cells. Most of our bacteria reside in the gut, where they help metabolize food; train the  immune system; and communicate with the nervous system. These host-microbe interactions are essential to our health. Yet, the evolution of many bacterial functions predates the evolution of the human lineage (and mammalian guts in general) by hundreds of millions of years. <b>To what extent have gut bacteria genetically adapted to our bodies and our diets?</b>

<br><br>

Most gut bacteria also harbor evidence of infection by viruses called phage.  Under some conditions, phage actively destroy large numbers of bacterial cells; while under other conditions, they lie dormant and protect against infection by other phages. Each phage type tends to infect only a few bacterial types, but both phage and bacterial types rapidly evolve. <b>How does rapid coevolution between phage and bacteria impact the structure and function of gut communities?</b>

       Malaria
</p></h2>

Malaria has killed perhaps two billion people over the last twelve thousand years. The deadliest form of malaria is caused by a parasite called <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>, which invades and multiplies within red blood cells (RBCs). Selection pressure to resist malaria parasites has resulted in higher incidence of RBC disease, such as sickle cell anemia, in malaria-endemic regions. Yet RBCs also vary widely among healthy people across the globe. <b>How does healthy RBC variation impact malaria parasites, and how has it evolved?</b>

<br><br>

Part of the reason <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> is so deadly is its extensive repertoire of genes that activate (and distract) our immune system. These “<i>var</i> genes” are so <i>var</i>iable that they are difficult to study with standard genetic techniques. <b>How do malaria parasites generate and maintain this genetic variation? How can we improve our approaches to studying it?</b>
